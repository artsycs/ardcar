# ardcar
Welcome to the Arduino robo car challenge.
Complete the lessons in order to get your car up and running.
Use the enclosed line follower program to get your intitial time for the track and then
modify the program to optimize it and race against your peers.

Fastest way to get onto the track is to complete build outlined in the assemble.pdf doc and then complete lesson 1 to make sure your wheels are spinning and in the right direction. ( make sure car is wired correctly ) 

Then proceed to lesson 5 and run the line follower on the Charlotte Motor Speedway race track. It should be able to complete the track without modification. Work your way through the Watkins Glenn and Sebring tracks to see if the code can handle the turns. Finally, you will need to update the code to complete the Nurburgring... one of the most challenging tracks on the planet.
